# Tic Tac Toe in PixeLAW with ML Bot

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game integrated into the PixeLAW world, where you can challenge an ML bot to a game of Tic Tac Toe!

### How to Play

1. **Accessing the Game**
    - Access the PixeLAW platform to play the game.
    - Ensure you have an account or access to the PixeLAW world where the game is hosted.

2. **Starting the Game**
    - Locate the Tic Tac Toe game within the PixeLAW world. It should be represented as a grid of pixels.

3. **Game Interface**
    - Interact with the game interface provided within PixeLAW to make your moves.
    - The grid represents the Tic Tac Toe board, and you'll choose your moves by selecting grid positions.

4. **Playing Against the ML Bot**
    - Start a game against the ML bot by initiating the game through the interface.
    - The ML bot will be making its moves based on its predictions and analysis of the game board.

5. **Making Moves**
    - You'll make your moves by selecting an available cell on the grid to place your 'X.'
    - The ML bot will respond with its 'O' move after your turn.

6. **Game Progression**
    - The game will proceed turn by turn until one player achieves a winning pattern or the board fills up (resulting in a draw).

7. **Ending the Game**
    - The game will declare a winner or a draw at the end based on the game outcome.

### Technical Details

- **ML Bot Integration**
    - The ML bot runs its inference on-chain and interacts with the game contract within PixeLAW.
    - The bot's moves are determined based on its analysis and predictions using an on-chain machine learning model.

- **Contract Interaction**
    - The game contract interacts with the core of PixeLAW, changing the state of the world visualized within PixeLAW based on the moves made during the game.

### Getting Started (For Developers/Contributors)

- To contribute or understand the technical aspects:
    - Access the game's code repository or development environment.
    - Explore the integration of the ML model, game contract, and PixeLAW core.

- Understanding the PixeLAW Environment:
    - Familiarize yourself with PixeLAW's grid-based representation and interaction mechanisms.

### Notes

- This game serves as a demonstration of integrating machine learning within PixeLAW and exploring interactions within decentralized environments.

- Feel free to explore, contribute, or adapt this project for learning or development purposes.

Enjoy playing Tic Tac Toe against the ML bot within the immersive PixeLAW world! ðŸŽ®âœ¨
